These are the files you need for Project 1

A. WHEN YOU CREATE YOUR OWN VERSION ..
######################################
You will create a file called "Makefile" that will make your own
solution program, as well as do some other things.  I would just
copy the Makefile-XXX program for the language you are using.
Please read the assignment for details, paying particular attention
to the fact that it MUST HAVE targets: build, user and command.


B. RUNNING WHAT'S HERE ...
######################################

Create an input file
> python3 gencases.py 100 10 > in.txt

Run Python version
> python3 selection.py in.txt > out1.txt

Run C++ version
> make -f Makefile-cpp
g++ -O6 selection.cpp -o selection

Run Java version
> ./selection in.txt > out2.txt
> make -f Makefile-java
javac selection.java
> java selection in.txt > out3.txt

Note that they all give the same output
> diff -q out1.txt out2.txt  ← Note: when diff outputs nothing, the two files match!
> diff -q out1.txt out3.txt  ← Note: when diff outputs nothing, the two files match!
