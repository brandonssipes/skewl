Project3 WormWorld Game (Chris Brown, 2018)

Once this file is unpacked, give the command

make Greedy

to compile and package as an executable my simple greedy worm, "greedy".
You can then run it in the environment, e.g. as

./p3game i1c ./greedy

EXECUTABLE FILES:
dbgreedy - an executable worm brain that is stupidly greedy (this is so you
           have a copy of the simple greedy worm, even if you modify Greedy.java)
jar2exec - a program used by the Makefile to make executables of java programs.
p3game   - the WormWorld game simulator.

GAME BOARDS:
i1a - a simple board
i1b - a bigger board
i1c - a simple board with lots of food

HELPFUL CLASSES:
The package "si335" has helpful classes: Dir, Pos, PosPlus and ShortestPathOracle.
If you do a

    import si335.*;

... you can use all of these.  The project page has links to the java doc for
these classes.

GREEDY DEMO PROGRAM
Greedy.java - source code you can understand, modify and steal if you wish
Makefile    - a makefile for Greedy, ... and more targets for your code.
