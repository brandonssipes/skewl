The SRT (Shortest Remaining Time) algorithm performed the best in the
Response Time because in smaller jobs that only need to be run for a
short period of time like a lot of the response jobs would get scheduled
first and be able to respond fast.

where as FCFS (First Come First Server) performed the
worst at Response time.  This is probably due to some large job coming
in and then slowing down all the other smaller jobs from being able to
finish.  This would slow down the response time due to these jobs not
being able to finish.

SRT was also the fastest at turnaround time. This is because with SRT
the majority of jobs can get in and get out without being slowed down by
bigger jobs so that proportionally their turnaround time is faster than
other algorithms.

RR (Round Robin) was the worst at Turnaround time. This is because the
OS has to keep switching around and does not let any process get the
focus that it needs to finish fast.
